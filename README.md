### Notes
Adjusting to XCode. Was stuck for a bit when the TableView did not display fully, but issue was resolved after i changed the simulator to iPhone 8. Also, I thought the scrolling feature was having issues, turns out it was because i could not use my fingers on my macbook's trackpad to scroll. I had to actually click and drag to scroll.
